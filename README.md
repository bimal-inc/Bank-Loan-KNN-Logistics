**Objective:**<br>
The classification goal is to predict the likelihood of a liability customer buying personal loans which means we have to build a model which will be used to predict which customer <br>will most likely to accept the offer for personal loan, based on the specific relationship with the bank across various features given in the dataset. Here I will be using the <br>Supervised Learning methods to predict which model is best for this problem amongst Logistic Regresssion, K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN) and Naive Bayes Algorigthm.<br>
